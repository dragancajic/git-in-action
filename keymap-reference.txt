~ Vim commands

1. Basic Vim commands

The most simple commands allow you to open and close documents as well as saving them. As with most other
text editors, there are protections in place to help you avoid exiting the editor without having saved what
you're working on.

:help [keyword] - Performs a search of help documentation for whatever keyword you enter
:e [file] - Opens a file, where [file] is the name of the file you want opened
:w - Saves the file you are working on
:w [filename] - Allows you to save your file with the name you've defined
:wq - Save your file and close Vim | or :x! + Enter
:x  - is a shortcut for :wq in Vim
:q! - Quit without first saving the file you were working on


3. Vim commands for editing

Those who use Vim tend to use the term "yank" where most people would use the terms copy and paste.
Therefore, the command for copying a word is yw, which stands for yank word, and the command for
pasting whatever has been copied is p, meaning put.
If you look up additional commands in the future, it can be confusing if you don't know what yank
and put mean when using Vim.

yy - Copies a line
yw - Copies a word
y$ - Copies from where your cursor is to the end of a line
v - Highlight one character at a time using arrow buttons or the h, k, j, l buttons
V - Highlights one line, and movement keys can allow you to highlight additional lines
p - Paste whatever has been copied to the unnamed register
d - Deletes highlighted text
dd - Deletes a line of text
dw - Deletes a word
D - Deletes everything from where your cursor is to the end of the line
d0 - Deletes everything from where your cursor is to the beginning of the line
dgg - Deletes everything from where your cursor is to the beginning of the file
dG - Deletes everything from where your cursor is to the end of the file
x - Deletes a single character
u - Undo the last operation; u# allows you to undo multiple actions
Ctrl + r - Redo the last undo
. - Repeats the last action


~ Simple Vim workflow example

If you haven't had a chance to play around with Vim much yet, you might be wondering what a simple workflow
looks like when using it. It's relatively simple:

1 Open a new or existing file with vim filename.
2 Type i to switch into insert mode so that you can start editing the file.
3 Enter or modify the text with your file.
4 Once you're done, press the escape key Esc to get out of insert mode and back to command mode.
5 Type :wq to save and exit your file. <-- { :x is a shortcut for :wq in Vim }

Of course, there is so much more you can do with Vim, however as a beginner, the above steps are what a simple
Vim workflow looks like.
